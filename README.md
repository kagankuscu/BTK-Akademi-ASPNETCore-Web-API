# BTK-Akademi-ASPNETCore-Web-API

## Leveled up my Web API skills with BTK Akademi's ASP.NET Core course!

This intensive program provided a comprehensive deep-dive into building powerful and user-friendly web APIs.

- **API:** APIs define how applications communicate and exchange data.
- **ASP.NET Core:** A framework for building web applications and APIs in C#.
- **Logging:** Records events and errors to help monitor and debug applications.
- **Models:** Represent real-world entities and their data in your application.
- **Postman:** A tool for testing and interacting with APIs.
- **EF Core:** Entity Framework Core, a library for interacting with databases.
- **Layer:** Organizes code into distinct sections for better maintainability (e.g., data access layer, business logic layer).
- **NLog:** A popular logging framework for .NET applications.
- **Global Error Handling:** A central mechanism to catch and handle errors throughout the application.
- **Automapper:** Automatically maps data between different object types.
- **Content Negotiation:** Allows APIs to respond with different data formats based on client preference (e.g., JSON, XML).
- **Validation:** Ensures data submitted to the API meets specific requirements.
- **Asynchronous Code:** Enables applications to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking.
- **ActionFilter:** Code that intercepts and modifies requests and responses processed by controllers.
- **Pagination:** Breaking down large datasets into smaller, manageable pages for easier retrieval.
- **Filtering:** Allows users to narrow down search results based on specific criteria.
- **Searching:** A powerful library for full-text search functionalities.
- **Sorting:** Ordering data based on specific criteria (e.g., date, name).
- **Data Shaping:** Controlling the structure of data returned by the API.
- **Hateoas:** Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State - allowing clients to discover available actions through API responses.
- **Option and Head:** HTTP methods used to get metadata about a resource without retrieving the entire content.
- **Root Documentation:** A central location for API documentation.
- **Versioning:** Managing different versions of an API.
- **Caching:** Storing frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.
- **Rate Limit and Throttling:** Controlling access to the API to prevent overload.
- **JWT, Identity and Refresh Token:** Mechanisms for user authentication and authorization.
- **API Documentation:** Clear and comprehensive instructions for using the API.

Thank you, BTK Akademi, for the excellent ASP.NET Core Web API course! I truly appreciate the comprehensive learning experience.
